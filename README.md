## Description

This Flutter app is a task management application that interacts with Firebase Firestore to post, retrieve, store and manage tasks.

### Features

#### Task Management:
The main screen shows a list of tasks retrieved from Firestore.
Each task is displayed with a checkbox, task description, and a delete button.
Users can mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox. Completed tasks will be shown with a strikethrough decoration.
Users can delete tasks by tapping the delete button.

#### Add New Task:

A Floating Action Button (FAB) at the bottom-right corner allows users to add new tasks.
When the FAB is pressed, a modal bottom sheet appears with an interface to add a new task.

#### Firestore Integration:

The app uses a Firebase Firestore to interact, store and manage tasks.
It fetches the list of tasks in real-time using a StreamBuilder.
It also shows the total number of tasks dynamically.
